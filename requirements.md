### Database Design â€“ Bookings Table

| Field         | Type      | Constraints                                          |
|---------------|-----------|------------------------------------------------------|
| id            | UUID      | Primary Key                                          |
| user_id       | UUID      | Foreign Key â†’ users(id), NOT NULL                   |
| property_id   | UUID      | Foreign Key â†’ properties(id), NOT NULL              |
| start_date    | DATE      | NOT NULL                                            |
| end_date      | DATE      | NOT NULL                                            |
| total_price   | DECIMAL   | NOT NULL                                            |
| status        | ENUM      | Values: `pending`, `confirmed`, `canceled`, `completed` |
| created_at    | TIMESTAMP | DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP                           |
| updated_at    | TIMESTAMP | DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP |

Indexes:

- ðŸ”¹ Index on `user_id`
- ðŸ”¹ Composite index on (`property_id`, `start_date`, `end_date`)
- ðŸ”¹ Index on `status` for fast filtering
